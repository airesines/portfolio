    <p id="workshops" class="details">[Bookbinding Workshops] <br>Kettle stitch binding & japanese binding <br>AE/ESAD — Matosinhos <br>june 2025</p>
    <p class="text-description">During my degree, I always tried to be able to develop my own prototypes, especially when it came to editorial design projects. This allowed me to become more independent when it came to the project prototyping process.
    Thus, in the context of AEESAD's Cultural Week, I was asked to design and conduct two workshops for the ESAD academic community, focusing on bookbinding techniques applied to the development of editorial project prototypes. The primary objective of this initiative was to share knowledge among students and empower them in the process of designing layouts for projects. <br>The following videos were produced and provided by AEESAD.</p>
